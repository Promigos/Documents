# Group 5 CSE-D - Payment Wallet
## Abstract
		
Money management is an integral part of our lives. But it is a hassle to maintain physical currency for regular activities like grocery shopping and recharging mobile phones. Therefore, payment wallets are on the verge of replacing physical currency and providing hassle free transactions. In this project, we propose a Payment Wallet which is capable of performing hassle free , fast and secure transactions. To access our services, users have to register with our mobile application. Then, they would be asked to provide their bank account details to transfer money into their wallet account. An user can add multiple bank accounts to add money according to their convenience. Transacting with other users can be done either by scanning the unique QR code of the payee or by searching the payee’s username in our application. If the transaction amount is unusual the transaction would be holded for one minute before completion for verification of amount.Once the transaction is complete, the user may chat with the payee or add him to his friends’ list. Adding a payee to his friends’ list helps in maintaining a database of close people and people the user transacts with regularly. One advantage of using our application is instant notification of information such as  transaction status , low wallet balance , payee chat notifications and incoming credits. We also provide an analytics section where a user could view his past transactions in a graphical manner. Unlike any other e-wallet application, we provide calculators for various types of loans and convertors for currency and cryptocurrencies. These calculators improve the user experience and make our app a one stop destination for all payment needs. During the course of the project development, we issue various types of  reports like **Expenditure-Revenue analytics report, Bug issues report, Burndown chart, Sprint report, Version Report and Test Execution Report** to keep track of our progress.
